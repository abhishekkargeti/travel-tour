        just a moment in time – just one hand reaching over
        the cIt’sounter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.

       But it’s a connection....

       We make sure everything we do honors that connection – 
       from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, 
       to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.

       From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago,
        in every place that we’ve been, and every place that we touch, 
        we've tried to make it a little better than we found it
</big></pre></h3>
